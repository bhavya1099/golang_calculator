FUNCTION_DEF=func Subtract(num1, num2 int) int 
```
Scenario 1: Subtracting two positive integers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the basic functionality of subtracting two positive integers where the first number is greater than the second.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define two positive integers, num1 = 10 and num2 = 5.
    Act: Call Subtract(num1, num2).
    Assert: Verify that the result is 5.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Subtracting 5 from 10 should yield 5. This test is crucial to ensure the basic arithmetic operation is performed correctly.

Scenario 2: Subtracting a larger number from a smaller number

Details:
  Description: This test checks how the function handles subtracting a larger integer from a smaller one, expecting a negative result.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define two integers, num1 = 5 and num2 = 10.
    Act: Call Subtract(num1, num2).
    Assert: Verify that the result is -5.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Subtracting 10 from 5 should yield -5. This test ensures that the function correctly handles negative results.

Scenario 3: Subtracting zero from a number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of subtracting zero from a positive integer.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define num1 = 7 and num2 = 0.
    Act: Call Subtract(num1, num2).
    Assert: Verify that the result is 7.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Subtracting 0 from any number should return the number itself. This test is important for verifying identity properties in arithmetic operations.

Scenario 4: Subtracting a number from itself

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that subtracting a number from itself results in zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define num1 = 8.
    Act: Call Subtract(num1, num1).
    Assert: Verify that the result is 0.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Subtracting a number from itself should return 0. This test checks the function's ability to handle such identity operations.

Scenario 5: Subtracting negative numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of subtracting one negative integer from another.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define two negative integers, num1 = -3 and num2 = -7.
    Act: Call Subtract(num1, num2).
    Assert: Verify that the result is 4.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Subtracting -7 from -3 is equivalent to adding 7 to -3, resulting in 4. This test ensures the function handles negative numbers correctly.

Scenario 6: Subtracting a negative number from a positive number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of subtracting a negative integer from a positive integer.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define num1 = 10 and num2 = -5.
    Act: Call Subtract(num1, num2).
    Assert: Verify that the result is 15.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Subtracting -5 from 10 is equivalent to adding 5 to 10, resulting in 15. This test ensures the function correctly handles the addition of a negative number.

Scenario 7: Subtracting a positive number from a negative number

Details:
  Description: This test checks how the function handles subtracting a positive integer from a negative integer.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define num1 = -8 and num2 = 3.
    Act: Call Subtract(num1, num2).
    Assert: Verify that the result is -11.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Subtracting 3 from -8 should yield -11. This test is important for verifying the function's behavior with mixed sign operands.
