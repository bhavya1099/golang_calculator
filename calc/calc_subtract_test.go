FUNCTION_DEF=func Subtract(num1, num2 int) int 
Scenario 1: Subtracting a positive number from a larger positive number.

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the Subtract function correctly subtracts a small positive number from a larger positive number.
Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement necessary as no external dependencies are utilized in the function.
    Act: Invoke the Subtract function with parameters num1 as 10 and num2 as 5.
    Assert: Verify the result of the calculation is as expected, in this case, 5.
Validation:
    The assertion is simply checking that the mathematical operation was done correctly, which is critical for the functionality of the Subtract function. 

Scenario 2: Subtracting a number from itself.

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the Subtract function correctly returns zero when num1 and num2 are equal.
Execution:
    Arrange: No external dependencies used.
    Act: Invoke the Subtract function with parameters num1 as 8 and num2 as 8.
    Assert: Verify that the returned result is 0.
Validation:
    This assertion ensures that the Subtract function handles the special condition where two equal numbers are provided and produces the correct result.

Scenario 3: Subtracting a positive number from a smaller positive number.

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the Subtract function returns a negative number when num2 is larger than num1.
Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement necessary as no external dependencies are used.
    Act: Invoke the Subtract function with a parameter of num1 as 5 and num2 as 10.
    Assert: Verify the returned result is -5.
Validation:
    This assertion checks that the Subtract function correctly handles the case where num2 is larger than num1, ensuring that it returns the correct negative result. 

Scenario 4: Subtracting a number from zero.

Details:
    Description: This scenario tests if the Subtract function correctly returns a negative result when num1 is zero and num2 is a positive number.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup necessary as no external dependencies are used.
    Act: Invoke the Subtract function with parameters num1 as 0 and num2 as 5.
    Assert: Assert that the returned result is -5.
Validation:
    This assertion checks that the Subtract function handles cases where num1 is zero and num2 is a positive integer correctly, returning the required negative result. 

Scenario 5: Subtracting zero from a number.

Details:
    Description: This scenario tests if the Subtract function correctly returns num1 when num2 is zero.
Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement necessary as no external dependencies used.
    Act: Invoke the Subtract function with parameters num1 as 10 and num2 as 0.
    Assert: Assert that the returned result is 10.
Validation:
    This assertion helps to ensure that the Subtract function correctly evaluates cases where num2 is zero, returning the value of num1 as the result. This is a normal convention in arithmetic subtraction.
