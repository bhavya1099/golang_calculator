FUNCTION_DEF=func Subtract(num1, num2 int) int
Scenario 1: Test Subtract With Positive Numbers

Details:
    Description: This test is designed to verify the Subtract function when it's provided with two positive integers.
Execution:
    Arrange: No additional setup is required except the declaration of two positive numbers e.g. 7 and 3.
    Act: Call the Subtract function as Subtract(7, 3).
    Assert: Use Go's built-in testing facilities to assert that the Subtract function returns the correct answer (4 assumes that num1=7, num2=3).
Validation:
    The expectation is that the Subtract function will subtract the second number from the first and return the correct result. In this scenario, the subtraction is straightforward and will follow normal mathematical procedures. This is a routine operation and is required to confirm basic functionality.

Scenario 2: Test Subtract With Negative Numbers

Details:
    Description: The test will check how function Subtract behaves when it's provided with two negative numbers.
Execution:
    Arrange: No additional setup is required except the declaration of two negative numbers e.g. -3 and -4.
    Act: Call the Subtract function as Subtract(-3, -4).
    Assert: Use Go's built-in testing facilities to assert that the Subtract function returns the expected result (1 assumes that num1=-3, num2=-4).
Validation:
    In this scenario, the Subtract function should take into account the principle of subtracting a negative number, which would essentially be adding that number to the original number. This scenario is important to confirm that the function can correctly handle these types of calculations.

Scenario 3: Test Subtract With Positive and Negative Numbers

Details:
    Description: The test will verify Subtract function behavior when it's given a positive number and a negative number.
Execution:
    Arrange: No additional setup is necessary except the declaration of a positive and a negative number e.g. 6 and -2.
    Act: Call the Subtract function as Subtract(6, -2).
    Assert: Use Go's built-in testing facilities to affirm that the Subtract function returns the expected result (8 assumes that num1=6 and num2=-2).
Validation:
    The Subtract function should correctly manage subtraction of a negative number, which would, in essence, add the number to the original number. This is crucial to make sure that the function can handle mixed number calculations in a correct way.

Scenario 4: Test Subtract With Zero

Details:
    Description: This test will determine Subtract function behavior when it's given zero and another number.
Execution:
    Arrange: No additional setup is required except the declaration of zero and another number e.g. 0 and 8.
    Act: Call the Subtract function as Subtract(0, 8).
    Assert: Use Go's built-in testing facilities to affirm that the Subtract function returns the correct result (-8 assumes that num1=0 and num2=8).
Validation:
    When zero is subtracted from any number, the result should be the same number. However, when any number is subtracted from zero, the result should be the negative of that number. This scenario verifies Subtract function's capability to correctly handle zero.
