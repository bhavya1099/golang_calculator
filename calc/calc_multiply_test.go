FUNCTION_DEF=func Multiply(num1, num2 float64) float64 
Scenario 1: Multiplication of two positive numbers

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the Multiply function works efficiently when two positive numbers are passed as parameters. 
Execution:
  Arrange: None, as this function does not require any additional set-up data.
  Act: Invoke the "Multiply" function with two positive numbers, for instance 5.0 and 3.0. 
  Assert: Use the Go "assert.Equal" facility to ensure that the function returns the expected result of 15.0.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on equality check, the logic is that multiplication of two positive numbers should yield another positive number. This test is crucial as it confirms regular behaviour of the function.

Scenario 2: Multiplication of positive and negative numbers

Details:
  Description: This test is designed to validate the functionality of the Multiply function when one number is positive and the other is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: No additional set-up data is required.
  Act: Call the "Multiply" function with one positive number such as 5.0 and a negative number such as -3.0.
  Assert: Use the Go "assert.Equal" facility to verify if the function returns the expected result of -15.0.
Validation:
  Selection of assertion is based on equality checks, the logic is that the product of a positive and a negative number is always negative. This test is critical to ascertain that our Multiply function implements this rule correctly.

Scenario 3: Multiplication of two negative numbers

Details:
  Description: This test confirms that the Multiply function correctly multiplies two negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No additional set-up data is required.
  Act: Call the "Multiply" function with two negative numbers, such as -5.0 and -3.0.
  Assert: Use the Go "assert.Equal" facility to confirm that the function returns the expected result of 15.0.
Validation:
  Choice of assertion is based on equality checks, the logic is that the product of two negative numbers is always positive. This test is essential as it aligns with the fundamental rule of multiplication.


Scenario 4: Multiplication by zero

Details:
  Description: This test is designed to check the Multiply function when one of the parameters is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No additional set-up data is needed.
  Act: Invoke the "Multiply" function with one parameter being zero and the other being any floating number, for instance 5.0.
  Assert: Use the Go "assert.Equal" facility to validate that the function returns 0.0, the expected result. 
Validation:
  The assertion is based on equality checks, where logic dictates that any number multiplied by zero equals zero. This test is crucial as it validates one of the basic rules of multiplication under the operation of our Multiply function.
