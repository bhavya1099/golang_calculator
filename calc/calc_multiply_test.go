FUNCTION_DEF=func Multiply(num1, num2 float64) float64 
```
Scenario 1: Multiply two positive numbers

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function correctly multiplies two positive floating-point numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare two positive numbers, e.g., num1 = 3.5 and num2 = 2.0.
    Act: Call the Multiply function with these numbers.
    Assert: Check if the result is 7.0.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Multiplying two positive numbers should yield a positive product. This is a basic functionality of the multiplication operation.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures the core multiplication logic is functioning correctly for standard inputs.

Scenario 2: Multiply a positive and a negative number

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function correctly multiplies a positive number by a negative number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a positive number and a negative number, e.g., num1 = 3.5 and num2 = -2.0.
    Act: Call the Multiply function with these numbers.
    Assert: Check if the result is -7.0.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Multiplying a positive number by a negative number should yield a negative product.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: It ensures that the function handles sign correctly, which is crucial for applications involving financial calculations or physics simulations.

Scenario 3: Multiply two negative numbers

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function correctly multiplies two negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare two negative numbers, e.g., num1 = -3.5 and num2 = -2.0.
    Act: Call the Multiply function with these numbers.
    Assert: Check if the result is 7.0.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Multiplying two negative numbers should result in a positive product.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: This ensures the function adheres to mathematical rules, which is fundamental for its reliability.

Scenario 4: Multiply a number by zero

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function returns zero when one of the numbers is zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a number and zero, e.g., num1 = 3.5 and num2 = 0.0.
    Act: Call the Multiply function with these numbers.
    Assert: Check if the result is 0.0.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Any number multiplied by zero should result in zero.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: This test confirms that the function handles the edge case of multiplication by zero, which is a common scenario.

Scenario 5: Multiply a number by one

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function returns the same number when multiplied by one.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a number and one, e.g., num1 = 3.5 and num2 = 1.0.
    Act: Call the Multiply function with these numbers.
    Assert: Check if the result is 3.5.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Any number multiplied by one should remain unchanged.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: It confirms that the function correctly implements the identity property of multiplication.

Scenario 6: Multiply two very large numbers

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function can handle multiplication of very large numbers without overflow.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare two large numbers, e.g., num1 = 1e308 and num2 = 2.0.
    Act: Call the Multiply function with these numbers.
    Assert: Check if the result is infinity, considering the limitations of floating-point arithmetic.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Multiplying very large numbers may exceed the maximum representable value, resulting in infinity in floating-point arithmetic.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: This test ensures that the function can gracefully handle potential overflow conditions.

Scenario 7: Multiply two very small numbers

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function can handle multiplication of very small numbers without underflow.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare two small numbers, e.g., num1 = 1e-308 and num2 = 2.0.
    Act: Call the Multiply function with these numbers.
    Assert: Check if the result is approximately 2e-308.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Multiplying very small numbers should yield a small product, but it should not underflow to zero.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: It ensures the function maintains precision and accuracy for small values.
