FUNCTION_DEF=func Multiply(num1, num2 float64) float64
Scenario 1: Multiply two positive numbers

Details:
    Description: This test checks the Multiply function with two positive numbers.

Execution:
    Arrange: Two positive numbers num1, and num2 are declared and initialized.
    Act: The function Multiply is invoked with num1, and num2.
    Assert: Use Go testing to compare the result from Multiply with the expected output.

Validation:
    The Multiply function is supposed to multiply the two given numbers. The choice of assertion is a simple equal-to comparison as the expected output is known. This represents the most common use case for the Multiply function.

Scenario 2: Multiply one positive and one negative number

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the Multiply function when multiplying one positive and one negative number.

Execution:
    Arrange: A positive number num1, and a negative number num2 are declared and initialized.
    Act: The function Multiply is invoked with num1, and num2.
    Assert: Use Go testing to compare the result from Multiply with the expected output.

Validation:
    The Multiply function should still return the correct multiplication of two numbers even when one of them is negative. This represents a common use case for the Multiply function.

Scenario 3: Multiply two negative numbers

Details:
    Description: This test checks the Multiply function when multiplying two negative numbers.

Execution:
    Arrange: Two negative numbers num1, and num2 are declared and initialized.
    Act: The function Multiply is invoked with num1, and num2.
    Assert: Use Go testing to compare the result from Multiply with the expected output.

Validation:
    The Multiply function is expected to return a positive result when multiplying two negative numbers. This test scenario ensures that the function can handle such situations.

Scenario 4: Multiply by zero

Details:
    Description: This test checks the Multiply function when one of the numbers is zero.

Execution:
    Arrange: num1 is declared and initialized with a non-zero number, and num2 is declared and initialized with zero.
    Act: The function Multiply is invoked with num1, and num2.
    Assert: Use Go testing to compare the result from Multiply with the expected output.

Validation:
    The Multiply function is expected to return zero when any of the numbers are zero. This test scenario ensures that the application behaves as expected in this situation.

Scenario 5: Multiply extremely large numbers

Details:
    Description: This test checks the Multiply function when the numbers are extremely large.

Execution:
    Arrange: Two extremely large numbers num1, and num2 are declared and initialized.
    Act: The function Multiply is invoked with num1, and num2.
    Assert: Use Go testing to compare the result from Multiply with the expected output.

Validation:
    This test scenario is essential to ensure that the Multiply function can handle large numbers without errors or overflow issues.
