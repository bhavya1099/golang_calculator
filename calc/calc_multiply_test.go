Test Cases:
    [TestMultiply]

Scenario 1: Test when both parameters are positive
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check for the standard functionality of the Multiply function when both number inputs are positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup or data is needed for this scenario.
  Act: Pass two positive numbers to the Multiply function (e.g. Multiply(4, 5))
  Assert: Using the Go testing assertion, verify the result is equal to the product of the two numbers (in this case 20).
Validation:
  The choice of this assert is to check that the function behaves as expected with standard operation. As Multiply is a basic function, correct operation is necessary for any mathematical operations.

Scenario 2: Test when both parameters are negative
Details:
  Description: This test verifies the Multiply function when both number inputs are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup or data is needed for this scenario.
  Act: Pass two negative numbers to the Multiply function (e.g. Multiply(-4, -5))
  Assert: Assert that the result is equal to the product of the absolute values of the two numbers (in this case 20).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the Multiply function correctly handles negative numbers, as multiplying them should result in a positive number. This case is important because different branches of logic might be used for negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Test when one parameter is negative and the other is positive
Details:
  Description: This test is designed to confirm the Multiply function correctly handles cases when one number input is negative and the other is positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup or data is needed for this scenario.
  Act: Pass one negative number and one positive number to the Multiply function (e.g. Multiply(-4, 5))
  Assert: Assert that the result is equal to the product of the absolute values of the two numbers multiplied by -1 (in this case -20).
Validation:
  In normal operation, multiplication involving a positive and a negative number should always result in a negative number, this test ensures that such operation works correctly in Multiply function.

Scenario 4: Test when one or both parameters are zero
Details:
  Description: This test ensures the Multiply function can correctly handle zero as an input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup or data is needed for this scenario.
  Act: Pass zero and another number (zero or non-zero) to the Multiply function (e.g. Multiply(0, 5))
  Assert: Assert that the result is equal to zero.
Validation:
  This test checks the scenario where one or both numbers are zero. Since any number multiplied by zero is zero, this test ensures that the Multiply function adheres to this rule.
