FUNCTION_DEF=func Divide(num1, num2 float64) float64 
```
Scenario 1: Division of Two Positive Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the basic functionality of the Divide function when dividing two positive floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set num1 to 10.0 and num2 to 2.0.
  Act: Invoke Divide(num1, num2).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 5.0.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the division of two positive numbers returns the correct quotient. This is important to validate the primary functionality of the Divide function in a typical use case.

Scenario 2: Division Resulting in a Fraction

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's ability to handle division resulting in a non-integer quotient.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set num1 to 7.0 and num2 to 2.0.
  Act: Invoke Divide(num1, num2).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 3.5.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the function correctly calculates the division resulting in a fractional value, ensuring accuracy in non-integer results.

Scenario 3: Division by Zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when attempting to divide by zero, which is undefined.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set num1 to 5.0 and num2 to 0.0.
  Act: Invoke Divide(num1, num2).
  Assert: Verify that the function handles division by zero appropriately (e.g., returns an error or a special value like NaN).
Validation:
  This test is crucial for ensuring the function's robustness and preventing runtime errors or crashes due to division by zero.

Scenario 4: Division of Zero by a Positive Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when the numerator is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set num1 to 0.0 and num2 to 5.0.
  Act: Invoke Divide(num1, num2).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 0.0.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that dividing zero by a positive number returns zero, which is mathematically correct and expected.

Scenario 5: Division of Two Negative Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that dividing two negative numbers results in a positive quotient.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set num1 to -10.0 and num2 to -2.0.
  Act: Invoke Divide(num1, num2).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 5.0.
Validation:
  The test checks that the function correctly handles sign inversion, ensuring that the division of two negative numbers yields a positive result.

Scenario 6: Division of a Positive Number by a Negative Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when dividing a positive number by a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set num1 to 10.0 and num2 to -2.0.
  Act: Invoke Divide(num1, num2).
  Assert: Verify that the result is -5.0.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the function correctly handles the sign when dividing numbers with different signs, which is essential for accurate mathematical operations.

Scenario 7: Division of a Negative Number by a Positive Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when dividing a negative number by a positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set num1 to -10.0 and num2 to 2.0.
  Act: Invoke Divide(num1, num2).
  Assert: Verify that the result is -5.0.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function correctly maintains the sign of the result when dividing numbers with different signs, ensuring mathematical correctness.

Scenario 8: Division Resulting in a Very Small Fraction

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to handle division resulting in a very small fractional number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set num1 to 1.0 and num2 to 10000.0.
  Act: Invoke Divide(num1, num2).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 0.0001.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the function can handle and return very small fractional values accurately, which is important for precision in mathematical calculations.

Scenario 9: Division of a Large Number by a Small Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when dividing a large number by a small number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set num1 to 1000000.0 and num2 to 0.0001.
  Act: Invoke Divide(num1, num2).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 10000000000.0.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function can handle operations involving large and small numbers, which is critical for applications dealing with a wide range of numerical values.
