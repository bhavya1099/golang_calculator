FUNCTION_DEF=func Divide(num1, num2 float64) float64
Scenario 1: Valid division operation with two positive numbers:

  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the Divide function properly performs division when given two positive numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: We do not need to set up any data beyond the numbers we will input into the method.
    Act: Invoke the Divide function with two positive numbers (example: 10 and 2).
    Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct quotient (expected: 5).
  Validation:
    This scenario validates that the general functionality of the Divide function works as expected. The expected result is calculated by executing the same operation separately and comparing it with the function's output. This test is essential to confirm the Divide function's principal purpose, as accurate calculation of division is the basis of its operation.

Scenario 2: Division of two negative numbers:

  Details:
    Description: This test checks whether the Divide function can handle division operations involving two negative numbers correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No additional setup required beyond the negative numbers to be input.
    Act: Invoke the Divide function using two negative numbers (example: -10 and -2).
    Assert: Check that the function returns the right quotient (expected: 5).
  Validation:
    This test ensures that the function can correctly handle negative numbers. The expected result (positive number) is based on the mathematical principle that the division of two negative numbers yields a positive number. This is necessary as negative numbers are common inputs in division calculations.

Scenario 3: Division of a positive number and zero:

  Details:
    Description: This test is designed to see how the Divide function behaves when zero is the divisor.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No additional setup is required beyond the number and zero to be input to the function.
    Act: Invoke the Divide function using a positive number and zero (example: 10 and 0).
    Assert: Check the output of the function. In this case, as division by zero is mathematically undefined, the function might return an error, return infinity, or lead to a panic.
  Validation:
    This scenario is crucial for testing the robustness of the function against erroneous inputs. Any function divide by zero should be treated as an exception and handled properly to avoid program crash or unexpected behavior. Depending on the chosen approach for handling this, the expected outcome may vary.

Scenario 4: Division of zero by a positive number:

  Details:
    Description: This test is designed to check whether the Divide function correctly handles the case where zero is the dividend.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No additional setup beyond the zero and the positive number we will input into the function.
    Act: Invoke the Divide function using zero and a positive number (example: 0 and 2).
    Assert: Verify that the function returns zero.
  Validation:
    This test case ensures that the function can correctly perform divisions where the dividend is zero. In mathematics, any number divided by zero yields zero, so this scenario verifies the function's compliance with this basic rule. Ensuring this test passes is critical for the overall correctness and stability of the Divide function.
