FUNCTION_DEF=func Divide(num1, num2 float64) float64 
Scenario 1: Divide Two Positive Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks whether the function can accurately divide two positive numbers. This is a typical use case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set num1 and num2 to be positive numbers (e.g. 10.0 and 2.0).
  Act: Call Divide function with num1 and num2 as parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the result returned by the function is expected (e.g. 5.0).
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly divides two positive numbers. This is a basic requirement for any division function in which both numbers are positive.

Scenario 2: Divide By Zero Case

Details:
  Description: This test checks for error handling when dividing by zero. Dividing by zero is undefined and thus should be properly handled.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set num1 and num2 where num2 is zero (e.g. 10.0 and 0.0).
  Act: Call Divide function with num1 and num2 as parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the result returned by the function is +Inf.
Validation:
  Division by zero is undefined but in Go programming, dividing a positive floating-point value by zero results to +Inf. This test assures that the function has such behavior.

Scenario 3: Divide Zero By Any Positive Number Case

Details:
  Description: This test checks the result when 0 is divided by any positive number. The result should be 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set num1 is 0 and num2 is any positive number (e.g. 0.0 and 10.0).
  Act: Call Divide function with num1 and num2 as parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the result returned by the function is 0.0.
Validation:
  When zero is divided by a non-zero number, it should always result to zero, regardless of the numerical value of the divisor.

Scenario 4: Divide Two Negative Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks whether the function can accurately divide two negative numbers. Dividing two negative numbers should result in a positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set num1 and num2 to be negative numbers (e.g. -10.0 and -2.0).
  Act: Call Divide function with num1 and num2 as parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the result returned by the function is expected (e.g. 5.0).
Validation:
  Division of two negative numbers should result in a positive outcome as negatives cancel each other. This test ensures that the function properly implements this rule. 

Scenario 5: Divide A Positive and A Negative Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks whether the function can accurately divide a positive number by a negative number. The result should be negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set num1 to a positive number and num2 to a negative number (e.g. 10.0 and -2.0).
  Act: Call Divide function with num1 and num2 as parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the result returned by the function is expected (e.g. -5.0).
Validation:
  Dividing a positive number by a negative number should result in a negative number. This test secures that the function is precise in this scenario as well.
