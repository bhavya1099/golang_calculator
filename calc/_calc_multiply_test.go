Scenario 1: Test the multiplication of two positive numbers

Details:
    Description: This test checks whether the function correctly computes the product of two positive floating-point numbers. It ensures that normal multiplication for standard inputs is handled correctly.
    Execution:
        Arrange: Prepare two positive floating-point values, e.g., `num1 = 5.0` and `num2 = 3.0`.
        Act: Call the `Multiply` function with these values as inputs.
        Assert: Verify that the output matches the expected result, which is `5.0 * 3.0 = 15.0`.
    Validation:
        Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Multiplication of positive real numbers should consistently produce the correct mathematical product. The test validates the core functionality of the `Multiply` method for standard input.
        Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures basic functionality of multiplication, critical for numerical computations.

Scenario 2: Test the multiplication of a positive number and zero

Details:
    Description: This test ensures that the function correctly handles multiplication when one operand is zero. The expected result for any number multiplied by zero should be zero.
    Execution:
        Arrange: Prepare a positive floating-point value, e.g., `num1 = 7.5`, and set `num2 = 0.0`.
        Act: Call the `Multiply` function with these values.
        Assert: Verify that the output matches the expected result, which is `0.0`.
    Validation:
        Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Mathematically, any number multiplied by zero results in zero. The test is crucial to validate edge scenarios involving zero as an operand.
        Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures correct handling of zero circumstances, which is fundamental to numerical computations.

Scenario 3: Test the multiplication of a negative number and a positive number

Details:
    Description: Verify that the multiplication of a negative floating-point number with a positive one produces a negative result, adhering to mathematical rules.
    Execution:
        Arrange: Set `num1 = -4.0` and `num2 = 2.0` as inputs.
        Act: Call the `Multiply` function with these inputs.
        Assert: Check whether the output matches the expected result, `-4.0 * 2.0 = -8.0`.
    Validation:
        Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Multiplication rules dictate that a negative times a positive results in a negative. This test validates correct sign handling.
        Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures accurate behavior for signed numbers, which is critical for many real-world calculations.

Scenario 4: Test the multiplication of two negative numbers

        Assert: Verify whether the output matches the expected result, `-3.0 * -2.0 = 6.0`.
    Validation:
        Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: A negative times a negative results in a positive. This test checks the handling of double negatives in multiplication.
        Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Validating numerical accuracy for negative inputs ensures predictable behavior for diverse scenarios.

Scenario 5: Test the multiplication of a number by one

Details:
    Description: Ensures that multiplying any number by one results in the number itself. This tests identity property in multiplication.
    Execution:
        Arrange: Prepare `num1 = 8.25` and `num2 = 1.0`.
        Act: Invoke the `Multiply` function using these values.
        Assert: Verify if the output matches the expected result, `8.25 * 1.0 = 8.25`.
    Validation:
        Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The identity property of multiplication asserts that any number multiplied by one remains unchanged. This test validates basic mathematical correctness.
        Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures consistency and reliability in numerical identity handling.

Scenario 6: Test edge case with very large floating-point numbers

Details:
    Description: Validate whether the multiplication function handles very large numbers accurately without causing overflow issues.
    Execution:
        Arrange: Prepare two large floating-point numbers, e.g., `num1 = 1e10` and `num2 = 5.0e9`.
        Act: Call the `Multiply` function with these inputs.
        Assert: Check whether the output matches the expected result, `1e10 * 5.0e9 = 5e19`.
    Validation:
        Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The test checks the capability of the function to handle large numbers while maintaining accuracy. It also validates overflow handling.
        Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Real-world applications may involve computation with large values. Ensures robustness and reliability.

Scenario 7: Test edge case with very small floating-point numbers

Details:
    Description: Validate whether the multiplication function handles very small numbers accurately without loss of precision.
    Execution:
        Arrange: Prepare two small floating-point numbers, e.g., `num1 = 1e-10` and `num2 = 1e-9`.
        Act: Call the `Multiply` function with these inputs.
        Assert: Check whether the output matches the expected result, `1e-10 * 1e-9 = 1e-19`.
    Validation:
        Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Ensures precision is retained during multiplication of tiny values.
        Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Validates the application's ability to handle computations on very small scales.

Scenario 8: Test edge case with zero multiplied by zero

Details:
    Description: Verify that zero multiplied by zero results in zero, adhering to mathematical rules.
    Execution:
        Arrange: Set `num1 = 0.0` and `num2 = 0.0`.
        Act: Call the `Multiply` function with these inputs.
        Assert: Verify whether the output equals the expected result, `0.0`.
    Validation:
        Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Mathematically, zero times zero results in zero. Validates correctness when zero is used as both operands.
        Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Establishes fundamental correctness in handling zero values.

Scenario 9: Test multiplication resulting in the maximum representable float64 value

Details:
    Description: Validate behavior when the multiplication operation approaches the limits of the `float64` type's representable range.
    Execution:
        Arrange: Assign `num1` and `num2` such values that their product approaches `math.MaxFloat64`.
