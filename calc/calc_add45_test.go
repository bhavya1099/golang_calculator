Test Cases:
    [TestAdd]

Scenario 1: Positive Number Addition

Details:
Description: This test is intended to validate the Add function with positive integer inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as this is a simple arithmetic test.
  Act: Invoke Add with positive integer inputs, such as Add(4,5).
  Assert: Verify that the result is as expected (in this case, 9).
Validation:
  We use simple equality assertions here as the math is not complex. Validating this ensures that the tool can handle basic arithmetic and that the function is working under normal operation.

Scenario 2: Negative Number Addition

Details:
Description: This test is intended to validate the Add function's ability to handle negative integer inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Again, no setup is required beyond choosing appropriate inputs.
  Act: Invoke Add with negative integers, such as Add(-2,-3).
  Assert: Validate that the result is the correct sum of the two integers (in this case, -5).
Validation:
  As with the prior test, we can use simple equality assertions. This test is important to verify that the function handles negative numbers correctly.

Scenario 3: Addition with Zero

Details:
Description: This tests the Add function's behavior when one or both inputs are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is needed.
  Act: Invoke Add with one or both inputs as zero, such as Add(5,0) or Add(0,0).
  Assert: Verify that the output is correct - in these cases, 5 and 0 respectively.
Validation:
  An equality assertion is sufficient for this test. This is another example of normal operation for the function, with input parameters close to the boundary of possible integer values.

Scenario 4: Large Numbers Addition

Details:
Description: This tests the Add function's ability to accurately add very large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup beyond choosing large inputs is needed.
  Act: Invoke Add with large inputs, such as Add(999999999,999999999).
  Assert: Validate that the output is correct (in this case, 1999999998).
Validation:
  We would use an equality assertion for this test. This tests the function's ability to handle large numbers, which is important for calculations that involve large data sets or very high magnitudes.

Scenario 5: Addition with Mixed Values (Positive and Negative)

Details:
Description: This tests the Add function's handling of inputs where one is positive and the other is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is needed beyond choosing appropriate mixed inputs.
  Act: Invoke Add with one positive and one negative number, such as Add(5, -3).
  Assert: Validate that the output is correct (in this case, 2).
Validation:
  We use an equality assertion for this test. It tests the function's ability to correctly handle mixed inputs, which could occur in various contexts in real-world applications.
