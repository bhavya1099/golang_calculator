FUNCTION_DEF=func Add(num1, num2 int) int
Scenario 1: Add Two Positive Integers

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly adds two positive integers.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up two positive integers num1=5 and num2=7.
    Act: Invoke the Add function with parameters num1 and num2.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result matches with expected outcome 12.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is straightforward - just compare the returned value with the expected value. The logic behind the expected result is the fundamental arithmetic operation of addition. The test is important as it ensures base functionality of the Add operation with positive number inputs.

Scenario 2: Add Two Negative Integers

Details:
    Description: This scenario is meant to check if the function correctly adds two negative integers.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up two negative integers num1=-3, num2=-2.
    Act: Invoke Add function with parameters num1, num2.
    Assert: Verify that the actual result equals to the expected outcome -5.
Validation:
    We will assert the expected result with the actual result which is returned by the Add function.
    The logic behind the expected result is the basic arithmetic operation of addition.
    This test is important as it checks the addition functionality for negative integers.

Scenario 3: Add a Positive and a Negative Integer

Details:
    Description: This test ensures that the function correctly adds positive and negative integers.
Execution:
    Arrange: Have one positive integer num1=5 and one negative integer num2=-3.
    Act: Invoke the Add function using num1 and num2.
    Assert: Confirm that the operation produced the expected result 2.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion involves a comparison of the returned and expected value. The logic behind the expected result is simple addition, and the test is crucial because it validates the function's ability to perform with mixed sign integers.

Scenario 4: Add with Zero

Details:
    Description: This tests that the function correctly handles addition of zero value.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up one integer num1=5 and zero num2=0.
    Act: Invoke the Add function with num1 and num2.
    Assert: Ensure that the result equal to 5.
Validation:
    Here, the choice of assertion is a simple comparison between the returned value and the expected. The logic behind the expected result is that adding zero to a number leaves the number unchanged. This test is important to confirm correct handling of zero.
