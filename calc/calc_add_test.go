FUNCTION_DEF=func Add(num1, num2 int) int 
```
Scenario 1: Adding Two Positive Integers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to correctly add two positive integers and return the correct sum.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare two positive integers, for example, num1 = 5 and num2 = 10.
    Act: Invoke the Add function with these two integers.
    Assert: Verify that the result equals 15.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion checks if the sum of 5 and 10 equals 15, which is the expected behavior of the Add function. This test is important to verify that the function correctly handles basic arithmetic operations.

Scenario 2: Adding Two Negative Integers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to correctly add two negative integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare two negative integers, for example, num1 = -3 and num2 = -7.
    Act: Invoke the Add function with these two integers.
    Assert: Verify that the result equals -10.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion checks that the sum of -3 and -7 equals -10, ensuring the function handles negative numbers properly. This is crucial for applications that deal with negative values.

Scenario 3: Adding a Positive Integer and a Negative Integer

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's ability to add a positive integer and a negative integer.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a positive integer and a negative integer, for example, num1 = 8 and num2 = -3.
    Act: Invoke the Add function with these integers.
    Assert: Verify that the result equals 5.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion ensures that adding 8 and -3 results in 5, confirming that the function correctly handles mixed sign inputs. This scenario is common in many real-world applications.

Scenario 4: Adding Zero to an Integer

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly adds zero to another integer.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare an integer and zero, for example, num1 = 0 and num2 = 12.
    Act: Invoke the Add function with these integers.
    Assert: Verify that the result equals 12.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion checks that adding 0 to 12 results in 12, which is expected. This test validates that the function maintains identity properties of addition.

Scenario 5: Adding Two Zeros

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when adding two zeros.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare two zeros, num1 = 0 and num2 = 0.
    Act: Invoke the Add function with these values.
    Assert: Verify that the result equals 0.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion ensures that adding 0 and 0 results in 0, confirming the function's handling of zero values. This is important for ensuring correctness in scenarios where zero is a valid input.

Scenario 6: Adding Max Int and 1

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when adding the maximum integer value and 1, which may cause an overflow.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare the maximum integer value and 1, for example, num1 = math.MaxInt32 and num2 = 1.
    Act: Invoke the Add function with these integers.
    Assert: Verify that the result is the expected overflow behavior (implementation-dependent).
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion checks if the function handles overflow conditions correctly. Understanding and testing overflow behavior is crucial for applications that may deal with large numbers.

Scenario 7: Adding Min Int and -1

Details:
  Description: This test evaluates the function's behavior when adding the minimum integer value and -1, potentially causing an underflow.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare the minimum integer value and -1, for example, num1 = math.MinInt32 and num2 = -1.
    Act: Invoke the Add function with these integers.
    Assert: Verify that the result is the expected underflow behavior (implementation-dependent).
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion ensures that the function handles underflow conditions. This test is important for applications that operate near integer limits.
