FUNCTION_DEF=func Add(num1, num2 int) int
Scenario 1: Testing Positive Number Addition

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly adds two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: We do not need to set up any data or mocks in this case.
  Act: We invoke the Add function with two positive integers.
  Assert: Using the Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the premise that adding two positive numbers should result in a positive number. The importance of this test lies in confirming the basic functionality of the Add function.

Scenario 2: Testing Negative Number Addition

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly adds two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: There is no need for data or mocks setup.
  Act: Invoke the Add function with two negative integers.
  Assert: Using Go's testing facilities to check if the result matches the expected negative number.
Validation:
  The assertion choice is driven by the fundamental rule of arithmetic that adding two negative numbers should yield a negative output. This test is crucial for demonstrating that the Add function works with negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Adding Zero

Details:
  Description: This test ensures if the function correctly handles addition when one of the numbers is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No data or mocks setup needed.
  Act: Invoke the Add function with a number and zero as parameters.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to ensure the output equals the input integer.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the mathematical principle that any number added to zero should yield the original number. This test confirms that the Add function accurately implements this principle.

Scenario 4: Adding Large Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test is to confirm if the function can handle addition of extremely large numbers without causing an overflow.
Execution:
  Arrange: No mock data needed in this case.
  Act: Invoke Addition function with very large integers.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to check if the result matches the expected large number.
Validation:
  The assertion choice is based on the understanding that Go's int type should be able to handle large numbers without causing overflow. This test is used to confirm if the Add function correctly implements this functionality.

Scenario 5: Mixed Addition (Positive and Negative)

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly adds a positive and a negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: No mock data needed in this case.
  Act: Invoke the Add function with a positive and a negative integer.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to ensure the result is as expected when a positive and negative number are added.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the fundamental arithmetic rule about adding a positive and a negative number. This test is crucial in evaluating the Add function's versatility in handling different types of inputs.
