```
Scenario 1: Convert a Valid Numeric String to Integer

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to convert a valid numeric string into an integer. The numeric string is well-formed without any leading or trailing spaces.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a valid numeric string, such as "123".
    Act: Invoke the `stringToInt` function with this string.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns the integer 123.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Since the input is a valid numeric string, the conversion should succeed without errors, and the integer 123 should be returned. This tests the function's basic functionality.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures the application can correctly parse and handle user input that is expected to be numeric.

Scenario 2: Handle a Non-Numeric String Gracefully

Details:
  Description: This test checks how the function handles a non-numeric string, expecting it to exit the program with an error.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a non-numeric string, such as "abc".
    Act: Invoke the `stringToInt` function with this string.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to check that the function exits with status code 2.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function should exit due to the inability to convert "abc" to an integer, matching the designed error handling behavior.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Validates that improper input is correctly detected and handled, preventing invalid data from being processed further.

Scenario 3: Convert a String with Leading Zeros

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to handle numeric strings with leading zeros and convert them correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a numeric string with leading zeros, such as "007".
    Act: Invoke the `stringToInt` function with this string.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns the integer 7.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Leading zeros should be ignored, and the resultant integer should be 7. This ensures that numeric strings are parsed correctly regardless of formatting.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures consistent and correct handling of numeric strings that may come from various sources with different formatting.

Scenario 4: Handle an Empty String

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when given an empty string, which should result in an error and exit.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare an empty string, "".
    Act: Invoke the `stringToInt` function with this string.
    Assert: Verify that the function exits with status code 2.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: An empty string cannot be converted to an integer, and the function should exit as per error handling design.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures the application does not process empty inputs as valid data, maintaining data integrity.

Scenario 5: Convert a String Representing a Negative Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to convert a valid numeric string representing a negative number into an integer.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a numeric string with a negative sign, such as "-456".
    Act: Invoke the `stringToInt` function with this string.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns the integer -456.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function should correctly interpret the negative sign and return the corresponding negative integer.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures that negative numbers are parsed and handled correctly, supporting a wider range of numeric inputs.

Scenario 6: Convert a Large Numeric String

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to convert a large numeric string into an integer without overflow errors.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a large numeric string, such as "2147483647" (maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer).
    Act: Invoke the `stringToInt` function with this string.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns the integer 2147483647.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function should handle the maximum 32-bit integer value correctly without overflow, ensuring robustness.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Validates that the application can handle large numbers, which might be critical for certain calculations or data processing tasks.
