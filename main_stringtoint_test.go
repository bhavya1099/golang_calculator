FUNCTION_DEF=func stringToInt(str string) int
Scenario 1: Test with correct input

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the function can correctly convert a string representation of an integer to the actual integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: A correct input string is required for this test. So, we can use a string like "123".
  Act: Invoke stringToInt with the provided string.
  Assert: The function should return an integer 123.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the conversion operation was successful and returned the expected results. The test is essential to confirm that the function can correctly perform its primary function, converting a string to an integer.

Scenario 2: Test with a negative number

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the function can handle strings representing negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: A string representing a negative number is needed, like "-123".
  Act: Invoke stringToInt with the provided string.
  Assert: The function should return the integer -123.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the function correctly handled the negative sign in the string. This test is necessary to confirm that the function can handle a wider range of integer values.

Scenario 3: Test with a non-numeric string

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check how the function handles input that cannot be converted to an integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: A non-numeric string is needed. We can use a string like "abc".
  Act: Invoke stringToInt with the provided string.
  Assert: The program should end with an exit code of 2.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly detected the faulty input and terminated the program as expected. This test is significant in identifying whether the function can gracefully handle errors.

Scenario 4: Test with a large number

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the function can handle large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: A string representing a large number is needed. Like "9999999999".
  Act: Invoke stringToInt with the provided string.
  Assert: The function should return the large integer 9999999999.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the function can handle string representations of large numbers. This test is crucial to ensure the function can handle a broad range of integer numbers.

Scenario 5: Test with a zero

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function can handle strings representing zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: A string representing zero is needed, like "0".
  Act: Invoke stringToInt with the provided string.
  Assert: The function should return the integer 0.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly handled the zero in the string. This test is important to confirm that the function can handle the full range of possible integer values.
