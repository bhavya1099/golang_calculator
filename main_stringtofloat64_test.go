Scenario 1: Valid String to Float Conversion

  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the conversion from string to float64 is successful when a valid numerical string is provided as input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a valid numerical string like "42.00".
    Act: Invoke the stringToFloat64 function with the valid numerical string as parameter.
    Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to verify that the returned float is 42.00.
  Validation:
    This assertion checks that the conversion function is working as intended, transforming strings into floats. 
    Ensuring that this function works properly is fundamental to its application within a calculator program, where number operations are a core functionality.

Scenario 2: Invalid String to Float Conversion

  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function handles errors correctly when a non-numerical string is provided as input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a non-numerical string like "abc".
    Act: Invoke the stringToFloat64 function with the non-numerical string as parameter.
    Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to confirm that the program exits with an error code 2.
  Validation:
    This assertion validates the error handling of the function; when a string that cannot be converted to a float is provided as input, the function should terminate the program 
    with a status code of 2. This is critical to the overall functionality of the calculator, because if the input is invalid, it alerts the user and properly halts the operation.
  
Scenario 3: Conversion of String Containing Large Float to Float64

  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function can successfully handle and convert a string that contains a large float number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string containing a large float number like "1.0e50".
    Act: Invoke the stringToFloat64 function with the created string as parameter.
    Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to verify that the returned float is the expected large float number.
  Validation:
    This assertion checks that the function can properly handle and return large float numbers. This is important in the context of a calculator application, where large numerical 
    operations could potentially be commonplace.
  
Scenario 4: Conversion of Empty String to Float64

  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check how the function behaves when an empty string is provided as input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide an empty string as ""
    Act: Invoke the stringToFloat64 function with the empty string as parameter.
    Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to confirm that the function returns 0 as a result.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the function treats empty strings as zero. This could be essential in preventing unexpected errors or crashes in the application due to null or 
    empty inputs.
