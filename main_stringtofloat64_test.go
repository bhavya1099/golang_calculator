FUNCTION_DEF=func stringToFloat64(str string) float64 
```
Scenario 1: Convert a valid string representing a positive float to float64

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function correctly converts a string representing a positive floating-point number into a float64 value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a string "123.456" which is a valid representation of a positive float.
    Act: Call the stringToFloat64 function with this string.
    Assert: Check that the returned float64 is equal to 123.456.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion checks that the function correctly parses a valid positive float string.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: This test ensures that basic functionality works for typical use cases, which is crucial for any application relying on numerical input parsing.

Scenario 2: Convert a valid string representing a negative float to float64

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function correctly converts a string representing a negative floating-point number into a float64 value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a string "-123.456" which is a valid representation of a negative float.
    Act: Call the stringToFloat64 function with this string.
    Assert: Check that the returned float64 is equal to -123.456.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion confirms that the function can handle negative numbers.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Proper handling of negative numbers is essential for applications that perform mathematical calculations.

Scenario 3: Convert a string representing zero to float64

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function correctly converts a string representing zero into a float64 value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a string "0" which is a valid representation of zero.
    Act: Call the stringToFloat64 function with this string.
    Assert: Check that the returned float64 is equal to 0.0.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion ensures that zero is correctly parsed, which is a common edge case.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Accurate parsing of zero is important in scenarios where zero values have special significance, such as in calculations or conditional logic.

Scenario 4: Handle conversion of a string with invalid float format

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function handles strings that do not represent valid floating-point numbers by exiting with an error.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a string "abc" which is not a valid float.
    Act: Call the stringToFloat64 function with this string.
    Assert: Verify that the function prints an error message and exits with status code 2.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies invalid input and handles it by exiting.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Proper error handling and feedback are crucial for diagnosing issues and ensuring robustness in applications.

Scenario 5: Convert a string representing a large float value to float64

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function correctly converts a string representing a large floating-point number into a float64 value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a string "1.7976931348623157e+308" which represents the maximum float64 value.
    Act: Call the stringToFloat64 function with this string.
    Assert: Check that the returned float64 is equal to 1.7976931348623157e+308.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: This assertion checks the function's ability to handle large floating-point numbers.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Handling large numbers is critical in applications involving scientific computations or large datasets.

Scenario 6: Convert a string representing a small float value to float64

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function correctly converts a string representing a very small floating-point number into a float64 value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a string "5e-324" which represents the smallest positive float64 value.
    Act: Call the stringToFloat64 function with this string.
    Assert: Check that the returned float64 is equal to 5e-324.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion ensures the function can handle very small numbers.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Precision with small numbers is essential in applications involving financial calculations or scientific measurements.
